This code is a JavaScript powered web app that allows a user to select players to fill a hypothetical 2019 Washington Nationals roster while following the actual budget and luxury tax costs. The code can be modified to work with any team, with the user only having to modify the player selection and prefilled roster spot buttons and remove or modify the custom switch tables used to handle Howie Kendrick and Wilmer Difo appearing multiple times (lines 21-39, 42-63 and 89-108). Under the helper folder is a simple python script that converts a csv file of player salary information into the selection buttons.
